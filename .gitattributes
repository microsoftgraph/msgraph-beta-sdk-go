# Enforce LF line endings for Go module and related files to avoid CRLF normalization issues on Windows
# Specifically prevent `LF would be replaced by CRLF` when staging files like go.mod
go.mod text eol=lf
*.mod text eol=lf
*.sum text eol=lf
*.go text eol=lf
# Fallback: treat everything else as text and let git normalize according to platform/default
* text=auto
